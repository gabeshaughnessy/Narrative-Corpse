Protect your site by filtering out profanity, swearing, abusive comments and other keywords of your choice. Flexible Plugin options available.

== Description ==

With this Plugin you can block out all profanity, swearing, abusive comments and any other keywords of your choice specified on the Plugin options page. The Plugin now features advanced control over content such as flexible strict filtering options. For example, flagged keywords which are embedded in whole words can now be ignored.

i.e. 'competition' will now be ignored if you have 'pet' as a flagged keyword. Previously it would ALWAYS appear as 'com***ition'. 

You can select which sections of your WordPress site to filter keywords from including:

* Posts (including recent posts sidebar widget)
* Post title
* Comments (including recent comments sidebar widget)
* Comment authors
* Tags
* Tag cloud

Keywords are replaced with wild card characters (set in the Plugin options). Further options retain the first letter of each filtered keyword, remove all letters (wild card characters only), or retain the first and last letter of the filtered keyword. For example, the keyword pluto would be replaced with either p****, *****, or p***o. Keywords can also be filtered using case insensitive, or case sensitive options.

There is also a setting to preserve current options if the Plugin is ever temporarily deactivated. When the Plugin is reactivated it will either reload the default settings or the previous options will remain. In the next version the option database entries for the Plugin will be removed only if the plugin files are deleted, and not just when the Plugin is simply deactivated which was the case with the pre 2.0 version.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I specify a character other than '*' to blank out swear words etc? =

As of version 1.1 you can now set this in the Plugin options page.

= Does the Plugin change the content in the WordPress database? =

No, the Plugin just filters content directly before it is displayed on the screen. No content in the database is ever altered.
